**`craigslist_bike_scraper.py`** is a precision tool for scraping _Santa Cruz bikes_ (specifically `bronson`, `5010`, and `nomad` models) from Craigslist listings around the SF Bay Area.

Think of it as your personal bike scout. Tireless. Unemotional. Fluent in HTML.  
And when it finds something tasty, it drops it directly in your Discord like this:  
📤 `Santa Cruz Bronson, Large — $3200 (Watsonville)`

## 🧠 Features

- 🕸 **Real-time Craigslist scraping** via headless Chromium & Selenium
- 🧽 **Smart attribute parsing** (model, size, year, etc.) using BeautifulSoup
- ⏳ **Waits for JavaScript-rendered content** before parsing
- ❗ **Keyword de-spamming**: Ignores those icky keyword-stuffed blocks
- 🧠 **False negative reducers**: Parses even when Craigslist uses funky formatting
- 📢 **Automatic Discord alerts** via webhook
- 🤖 **Logs everything** it finds, skips, or posts
- 🧯 **Fails gracefully** on slow pages, missing elements, or Razor scooters

---

## ⚙️ Setup

> Make sure you’ve got Chrome/Chromium installed, and your Python environment ready.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 requests

CHROMEDRIVER_BIN = "/usr/bin/chromedriver"
CHROME_BIN = "/usr/bin/chromium-browser"
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your_real_webhook_here"

💡 How It Works
🎯 Match Strategy
gallery8.py scans up to 200 Craigslist bike listings using:

Title

Attribute summary (div.attrgroup)

Model keywords: ["bronson", "5010", "nomad"]

Size keywords: ["large", "lrg", "lg", "size l", ...]

It only posts if both model and size are confidently matched.
Otherwise? It logs and moves on like a professional.

🚨 Error Handling
Situation	Behavior
attrgroup not found	Waits up to 10s. If missing? Skips gracefully.
Model found, size missing	Skips, logs debug info (but doesn’t ping Discord)
Discord webhook not set	Warns you and avoids accidental HTTP 400 flood
Unexpected Craigslist formatting	Falls back to full-text search for size/model
Razor scooters, hoverboards, etc. 🛴	Logs a sarcastic comment and skips 😎

📤 Discord Output
Matches get posted to your Discord channel using embed fields:

yaml
Copy
Edit
🎯 Santa Cruz Bronson
💰 Price: $4,200
📏 Size: Large
📍 Location: Watsonville
🔗 Link: [View Listing](https://craigslist...)
🖼 Thumbnail: [inline image]
Looks fancy. Makes you feel like you're running a used-bike intelligence agency.

🧪 Debugging
Set print points as needed — the script already outputs:

Found gallery URLs

Raw HTML dumps of .attrgroup

Attribute dict (attr_kv)

Model/size matching logic

💬 Future Ideas
🤖 Add fuzzy model matching (e.g., bronsoncc, nomadv4)

🧠 Smarter size parser: convert "54cm" or "17.5in" → M/L estimates

📦 JSON/CSV export

🚨 Duplicate prevention (don’t post the same listing twice)

🧼 Auto-clean keyword spam and suspicious tags
